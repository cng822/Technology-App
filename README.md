# CS302-Java-2020-Group18 - Technology Retail App

The purpose of this app is to display three different technology-related categories using Android Studio.

## Motivation

Technology has become a huge part of everyone's life and the demand for technical products is greater than ever. As future Computer Systems Engineers, technology products play a huge role in our lives. Having an application that is 
able to provide details of specific products as well as allowing us to search for the product we are wanting. 

## What Does It Do?

This app will sell technology-related items from three categories; Computer/Laptops, Phones, and Watches. This app will have the ability to perform several features such as searching for specific items available through the search bar and the ability to display the top three items. Information on specific items can be displayed after selecting them on our app and the app will be able to generate a list of items in specific categories. The app will also have the functionality of sorting items from best selling or from most viewed.
